# Splittail microsatellite-RNA comparison
A repository for code used in a comparison of microsatellite and RNA data in the Sacramento splittail.

Now published in [_BMC Genomics_ in the article "RNA sequencing describes both population structure and plasticity-selection dynamics in a non-model fish" ](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-021-07592-4)

Note that the RNA data come from Jeffries et al. 2019 "Divergent transcriptomic signatures in response to salinity exposure in two populations of an estuarine fish"

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.12799

Microsatellite data come from Mahardja et al. 2014 "Interannual variation in connectivity and comparison of effective population size between two splittail (*Pogonichthys macrolepidotus*) populations in the San Francisco Estuary"
