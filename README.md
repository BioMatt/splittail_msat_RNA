# Splittail microsatellite-RNA comparison
A repository for code used in a comparison of microsatellite and RNA data in the Sacramento splittail.

Note that the RNA data come from Jeffries et al. 2019 "Divergent transcriptomic signatures in response to salinity exposure in two populations of an estuarine fish"

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.12799

Microsatellite data come from Mahardja et al. 2014 "Interannual variation in connectivity and comparison of effective population size between two splittail (*Pogonichthys macrolepidotus*) populations in the San Francisco Estuary"
